# Seed Data & Config Repository 

This repository will host:
1.	MongoDb Seed for mongorestore
2.	MySql SQL dump 
3.	Sample environment file .env to be copied into laravel installation. 
This sample will be renamed as _env as workaround for Windows not recognizing "." as valid filename start character, and to ease visibility in Linux/MacOS as "." prefix will hide the file from console and file manager by default.
